		<p>Academic English writing has many conventions. Part 8 helps you learn these conventions and so to (using the words of the WPA Outcomes) “develop knowledge of linguistic structures, including grammar, punctuation, and spelling, through practice in composing and revising.” This part will also help you “understand why genre conventions for structure, paragraphing, tone, and mechanics vary” and will help you “gain experience negotiating variations in genre conventions.”</dl>
