		<p>The WPA Outcomes Statements describes critical thinking “as the ability to analyze, synthesize, interpret, and evaluate ideas, information, situations, and texts.” To do this work, you first have to locate the ideas and information—the sources—you will use to spur your thinking as you write.</p>
	<p>Part 2 thus helps you understand the differences among kinds of information available to you, such as primary and secondary sources and academic and popular sources. Then, you will learn how to determine which kinds of sources are most useful to your writing and how to find them.</dd>

		<p>In this part, you learn how to find—how to research—ideas and information that helps you think richly about your topic. Such research work happens at the beginning of most communication projects, but keep in mind that you may need to return to research as your project develops and new questions develop for you.</p>
