		<p>Drafting a paper puts you closer to a finished paper—but also enables you to figure out what really matters to you in your writing, a necessary part of a composing process.
	Seeing a draft in process helps you see where revision is necessary—and allows others to give you 
    feedback, which you need to learn how to request and how to use. All these parts of a composing process engage you with the social and collaborative aspects of all writing.</dl>
