00:00:00,616 --> 00:00:03,956
>> Hello, my name is Jerro Sand [assumed
spelling], and today, I'm working on a paper

2
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:06,736
for an econ class about how
nutritional information

3
00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:09,386
on packaging affects people's food purchases.

4
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:14,886
So I was really happy when I found this
article about how parents mostly want

5
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:19,746
to buy healthy food for their families, but
their decision is based on the cost of the food

6
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,916
and whether or not they're being
distracted by their kids while shopping.

7
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:27,516
I found a PDF of this article on the
database of my college library website.

8
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:33,666
I'm following the APA format for a periodical,
but then I have to add additional information

9
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:35,896
that comes along with finding
this article online.

10
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:41,086
As with any citation in APA format,
I put the author's name first.

11
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:46,526
In the article, there are three authors.

12
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:50,626
Science and social science articles
often have a couple of authors,

13
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:52,236
which is always a bit of a pain to type.

14
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:56,316
You've got to put the author's first
-- the first author's last name first,

15
00:00:56,466 --> 00:01:02,586
and then that person initials, including
two initials if two names are given.

16
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:06,256
But luckily, in this article, these
authors only use their first names.

17
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:11,656
Then you would do the same for its second
author, and then the same for a third author.

18
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:17,036
And when you do this, you've got to keep
all the commas and periods all straight,

19
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:22,006
a period after each initial and then
a comma before each new last name.

20
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:27,376
At least AP lets you put an ampersand
before the last author's name instead

21
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,196
of having to spell the word "and."

22
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,186
You can find the ampersand
on your keyboard by holding

23
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:34,746
down your shift key and pressing
the number seven.

24
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:39,526
Then in parenthesis, you put the
year the article was published.

25
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:43,466
So right here, this article
was published in 2009.

26
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:48,426
Next in an APA citation, you put the
article's title in quotation marks.

27
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:54,936
Here, the article's title is "An Exploration
of parents' food purchasing behaviours."

28
00:01:55,406 --> 00:02:02,816
Only the first word of the title gets
capitalized, as seen here, and if there's colon

29
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:06,826
in the middle of the title, the first word
after the colon also gets capitalized.

30
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,146
And notice how I kept this
British spelling of "behaviours"

31
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:12,766
since that's how it appears in the title.

32
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:15,656
So when you cite your source, you have

33
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:18,396
to spell the title exactly how
it's spelled in the article.

34
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:22,446
Then comes the periodical's name in italics.

35
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:24,966
"Appetite" is the title of this journal.

36
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:32,016
A comma goes after the periodical name, followed
by the volume number of this particular journal.

37
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:36,756
The volume number for this particular
journal is 53, found right here.

38
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,616
It's following the periodical name.

39
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:41,736
The volume number goes right
after the periodical name

40
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:43,686
in the citation, and it is in italics, too.

41
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:46,856
If there were an issue date, it would be --

42
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:49,796
it would go into parenthesis
following the volume number,

43
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:53,256
but because there is no other number
in this information at the very top

44
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,646
of the page, I can leave out an issue date.

45
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:57,616
The page numbers come next.

46
00:02:57,896 --> 00:03:01,196
It's awfully sweet of this periodical
to put the page numbers here

47
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:02,556
at the very top of the page, too.

48
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:07,336
If I had found a print -- found this
article in the print version of the journal,

49
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,036
I'd be done now, but now
I have to add information

50
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:12,246
about having found the article online.

51
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:17,036
At the very end goes this
digital object identifier.

52
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:22,316
This number is usually somewhere on the first
page of an online periodical, but you often have

53
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:23,586
to look a bit in this periodical.

54
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,186
It's way down at the bottom.

55
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:29,916
Here in this article, it's down at the lower
left-hand corner of the article right here.

56
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:35,146
I like this idea of digital
object identifier code

57
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:38,886
so that we can always find an article
online even if someone moves it around.

58
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:46,276
The thing I always forget is that there is no
period after the digital object identifier.

59
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:52,826
I worked hard to remember always to put a period
at the end of a citation, but you can't put one

60
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:58,106
with a digital object identifier because
people would think the period was a part

61
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,716
of the identifier, and it's not, so no period.

62
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,326
And that's it.

63
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:03,676
I'm done with this citation.

64
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,576
I only have six more to do
before I can go to bed.

65
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:06,206
Thank you.
