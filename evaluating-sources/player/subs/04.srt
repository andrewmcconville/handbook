00:00:00,376 --> 00:00:01,056
>> Phoebe [assumed spelling]: Hi.

2
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:01,826
I'm Phoebe.

3
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:05,856
I'm writing a paper for an education
class, and I got interested in how violence

4
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:07,626
in society affects student learning.

5
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:12,096
The U.S. Government has some great
resources about aspects of education here.

6
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:15,226
And I found one website attached
to the Department of Education

7
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:17,386
that is all about statistics in education.

8
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:19,826
I found a report about school crime.

9
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:23,346
And it has information in it about
how fear of violence affects students.

10
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:28,816
Because this report is a non-periodical,
it isn't published weekly or monthly.

11
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:32,006
I'm following the APA pattern
for non-periodicals.

12
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,616
And then adding the online
information at the end.

13
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:39,046
Because there's no named author for
the report, I start with the name

14
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:40,976
of the responsible government agency.

15
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:43,396
There's a lot of different
names on this website,

16
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:48,006
but the one at the top left that's biggest
is also what's named in the website's URL.

17
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:50,746
So that's a good sign of
who is most responsible.

18
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:53,826
So for this citation, I'm
putting National Center

19
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:57,626
for Education Statistics with a period after it.

20
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:03,156
The date is easy to find here at the top right.

21
00:01:04,806 --> 00:01:09,276
Even though the information is about
2008, the report was published in 2009.

22
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:13,036
So I put the date in parentheses
after the responsible agency.

23
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:14,326
And add a period.

24
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:22,316
Then I put the report title in italics just
like any other non-periodical like a book.

25
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:29,706
Only the first word gets capitalized,
and then there's a period at the end.

26
00:01:29,706 --> 00:01:33,056
Down at the bottom of the webpage,
I found the place of publication.

27
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,126
Washington, DC.

28
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:41,176
The other names back at the top of the
page tell who published this report.

29
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:46,306
And I need to be careful to get them all.

30
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:50,806
Finally, this website doesn't provide any
digital object identifier for this report.

31
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:54,296
So I have to copy the URL and
paste it into my citation.

32
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:59,396
I sometimes forget to put retrieved from in
front of the URL, but I remembered this time.

33
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:04,396
And I also remembered not to put a period
after the URL since that could confuse people

34
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:10,976
and make them think they should type a period
when they enter the URL to look at this source.

35
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:12,786
And that's it.
