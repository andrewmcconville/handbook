00:00:01,456 --> 00:00:02,716
>> Hi. I'm Leah Manning.

2
00:00:03,026 --> 00:00:07,856
For my comp class, I'm writing a paper on
copyright laws and why they have to change

3
00:00:07,856 --> 00:00:12,636
because of digital networks, which make it
a lot easier for people to exchange text.

4
00:00:12,636 --> 00:00:18,726
So this book that I found argues that current
copyright law gets in the way of creativity.

5
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:21,356
And it is called "Moral Panics
and the Copyright Wars."

6
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:23,716
I liked this book a lot.

7
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:26,196
It is written by a copyright
lawyer, which helps,

8
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:27,966
so it was a pretty good source for my paper.

9
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:33,506
Anyway, when I was using this
book for my MLA work cited list,

10
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:37,086
I was just going over how I
should find and everything.

11
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:42,526
So, for me, I have a cover on my book, so my
title and author aren't wonderfully lifted,

12
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:47,786
but if you don't have a cover, or it's just
really dirty, you can turn to the title page,

13
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:50,806
which, again, will have the
title and the author's name.

14
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:53,826
The first thing you need is the
author, and his name is right here.

15
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,166
Pretty easy to spell.

16
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:58,866
You put the last name first, first name
last, and then a period after that.

17
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:02,326
Next, you're going to move to
the title, and an important thing

18
00:01:02,326 --> 00:01:06,416
to remember there is you're only supposed
to capitalize the important words.

19
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:10,016
So, like, here, I'm not going to capitalize
any of the articles or conjunctions

20
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,966
and just keep the important words there.

21
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,066
And after I type that up, put a period.

22
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:19,216
Next thing I have to look for
is the place it was published,

23
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:22,036
so I turn the page, and here it is.

24
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:26,576
Really small print and there's a
bunch of different cities listed here.

25
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:28,976
If that happens, just pick the first one.

26
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:30,676
So for me, that is Oxford.

27
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:35,546
I am not going to write that Oxford is in
England because any academic reader should know

28
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:40,106
that Oxford is in England, so I'm going
to write Oxford and then put a colon.

29
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:41,826
Now, I have to look for the publisher.

30
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:45,316
The publisher is right up here
at the very top of the page.

31
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:47,066
It says Oxford University Press.

32
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:50,916
However, I'm not going to write
out the words University Press.

33
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:55,916
I am going to write a capital U and a
capital P. that stands for University Press,

34
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,686
and every academic reader will know that.

35
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:00,986
So my citation for the publisher
will say Oxford UP.

36
00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:03,426
And then I will put a comma.

37
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,626
And now I'm going to look for the year.

38
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:09,716
Usually, it's really easy, and there is
a little copyright symbol and the year.

39
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:11,796
But in my case, that didn't happen.

40
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:16,406
I looked, couldn't find it, took it to a
professor who pointed out to me the Library

41
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:20,236
of Congress Cataloging and
Publication Data -- long words.

42
00:02:20,236 --> 00:02:20,576
Yeah, I know.

43
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:25,706
What it is is that the Library of Congress
is the official library of the United States,

44
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:30,046
and it is their job to make sure they have
track of all new important literature.

45
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:34,036
So to make that easier for them,
they put together this data.

46
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:37,586
All of this is the standardized
information about the book.

47
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:39,996
And at the very end is a number.

48
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:45,496
That number is called the Library of Congress
control number, and the first four digits happen

49
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:47,676
to be the year of publication for the book.

50
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:49,286
So I find that year.

51
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:51,546
For me, it is 2009.

52
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,316
So after the year, you put a period.

53
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:55,526
You think you're at the end of
the your citation, but you're not.

54
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:59,096
You have to write the medium in
which your citation was written.

55
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:01,376
So for me, it's obviously print.

56
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,146
So I put the word print, a period, and
I'm officially done with my citation.

57
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:09,236
So I hope my little foray into
citation will help you out on yours.

58
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:11,276
Good luck.
