00:00:00,626 --> 00:00:01,096
>> Hi there.

2
00:00:01,156 --> 00:00:02,346
I'm Gabriel Vatova [assumed spelling].

3
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:05,596
I'm finishing a required paper
for a class on research writing.

4
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:10,066
I've been interested in the ethics of how
photographs are used online, and so I was happy

5
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:11,746
to find this article in the "New York Times."

6
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:16,466
It's about how parents want to put their
kids' pictures online so grandparents can see,

7
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:21,426
but then the parents get angry and surprised
when they learn the pictures are used

8
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:23,336
in advertisements without their permission.

9
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:29,276
To make this citation, I followed
the MLA pattern for web pages.

10
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:34,006
And so, like with any citation in MLA
format, I began with the author's name,

11
00:00:34,426 --> 00:00:36,986
putting the last name first,
and then his first name.

12
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:40,556
The author's name is pretty small
here, but it was easy to find.

13
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:43,936
I was real careful about
spelling this man's last name.

14
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:46,466
I don't know how to pronounce it
-- Krenka [assumed spelling] --

15
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:48,566
but I wanted to be sure I got it right.

16
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:51,946
And then I put the title of
the article on the web page.

17
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:54,276
The title was pretty easy to find here.

18
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:55,186
It's nice and big.

19
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:57,876
And I put the title inside quotation marks

20
00:00:57,986 --> 00:01:00,626
because this is an article in
a periodical and not a book.

21
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:05,496
Then I put the name of the website, which
on this web page is easy to see at the top.

22
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:09,186
Website titles usually are at
the top left of a web page.

23
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:12,906
In the citation, the name of
the website goes in italics,

24
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:15,666
and I left out the "the"
at the front of the name.

25
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:19,216
You can leave off "a" or "the"
from website titles in MLA style.

26
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,606
Next comes the name of the publisher.

27
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:25,496
If this is on a web page, it's
either at the top or the very bottom.

28
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:26,566
You just have to look.

29
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:36,156
In this case, the name is at the very bottom
and is the same as the name of the website.

30
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:39,406
So I put "New York Times" into
the citation a second time.

31
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:43,926
This time, though, it's not
italicized, and, like, before,

32
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:45,906
I leave off the "the" at the front.

33
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:50,916
And when you put the name of a publisher in
MLA style, you can leave off company, too.

34
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,496
Next comes the date that
the article was published.

35
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:56,466
The "New York Times" makes
this pretty easy to find.

36
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:58,636
They put it right under the author's name.

37
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:04,736
I had to remember to put the date in the format
that MLA style wants with the date first,

38
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:10,106
then the month in the abbreviation the
MLA wants, and then, finally, the year.

39
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:14,266
But if you can't find a full date
and month and year on a website,

40
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:17,446
you should just put the month
and the year, or just the year.

41
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:21,656
And if you can't find any
date, put ND for "no date."

42
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:27,766
Then I put the medium, web, and the date that I
accessed the web page, again, in the same format

43
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,616
at the date the web page was published.

44
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:34,096
I always go back and check the punctuation
in my citations to be sure I got it right.

45
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:38,426
In citations like this one, you have to
put a period after each separate element,

46
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,986
except that there's a comma
after the publisher's name

47
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:43,086
and quotation marks around the article title.

48
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:45,966
And then the periodical name
needs to be in italics.

49
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:50,676
I sometimes forget to put a period at the
end, so I always have to double-check that.
