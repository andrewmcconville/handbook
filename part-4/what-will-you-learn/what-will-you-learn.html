		<p>In Part 4, Analyzing Arguments and Engaging with Sources,we help you deepen your abilities to identify the parts of a text and how those parts work together in service of the text’s overall purpose. We also help you learn reasons and conventions for summarizing, quoting, and paraphrasing your sources—and how you can learn from having your sources “talk” to each other.</p>

		<p>In working through this part, you use reading for inquiry, learning, critical thinking, and communicating in various rhetorical contexts. You will learn forms of analysis that apply to all texts, learning to see and think about relations between assertion and evidence, the interplay between verbal and nonverbal elements, and to how these features function for different audiences and situations. You will also start integrating your ideas with those from your sources.
