		<div class="body-copy">
			<p>Composing a paper, you arrange words into sentences into paragraphs, hoping the arrangement will engage your readers. Composing a poster, you arrange words and photographs and colors, hoping viewers will want to look at the poster and heed its purposes. Composing a podcast, you arrange voices and other sounds, hoping others want to listen. In other words, composing—as we use it in this book—refers to written, visual, oral, and mixed-media texts that you create.</p>

			<p>This composing process shapes what we propose in this handbook. If you are to be an effective and satisfied composer, you need to learn the designs that are available to you—the conventions, grammars, and expectations—so you can make what audiences can understand but also so that you can design for your own purposes.</p>
