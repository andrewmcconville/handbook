			<div>
				<p>As your first project for your internship, I want you to prepare a report on our in-office recycling program.</p>
				<p>This report should be no more than 3 pages and should be directed to me, the office manager. I want to receive this report no later than September 29.</p>
				<p>This report will help me make decisions about improving the program; producing this report will also help you get to know everyone in the office, how people here work together, and about our office values of efficiency and care for our resources.</p>
				<p>I would like you to interview individually each of our six full-time office staff, to find out how each uses the recycling program. Do they find our system efficient and easy-to-use for recycling paper from the officeâ€™s printers? Do they have suggestions for how to improve the system so that less paper is thrown away rather than recycled?</p>
				<p>In your report, please summarize your findings and make recommendations in line with the purposes I have described above.</p>
