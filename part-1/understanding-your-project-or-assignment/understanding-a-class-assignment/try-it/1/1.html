			<h1>Writting a summary</h1>
			<p>For next class, I’ve asked you to read the next chapter, titled “Polaroids,” from Anne Lamott’s book, Bird by Bird.</p>
			<p>In addition to reading the chapter, I also want you to write a 250-500 word summary of the chapter. Writing this summary will help you prepare to discuss the chapter in class by helping you focus on what you think is most important in the chapter.</p>
			<p>With this assignment, I want you to pay attention to how to summarize without bringing in your own opinions. In other words, I want you to learn to read generously, to pay attention to a writer’s ideas and to try to get a sense of the whole before you pull in your own personal responses.</p>
			<p>In class, when we discuss the chapter and what you all think Lamott is trying to achieve, you will have plenty of time to bring in your opinions.</p>
			<p>Write the summary for a reader like me, your teacher, who expects formal academic prose, and format your writing with an MLA header (as we’ve discussed in class).</p>
			<p>I will collect your summaries at the beginning of class.</p>
