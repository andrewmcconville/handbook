			<p>Three levels of purpose shape class writing assignments:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><strong>A teacherâ€™s purposes.</strong> You might be asked to produce polished descriptive prose; carry outÂ research, integrate it into a paper, and document it; or develop and produce a persuasive argument. Look at new assignÂ­ments for stateÂ­ments of what the teacher hopes you will learn; if they are not there, ask.</li> 
				<li><strong>Your own purposes for your own learning:</strong> On what skills do you need to focus (some aspect of grammar, or transitions, orÂ writing complex paragraphs)?</li>
				<li><strong>The paperâ€™s purposes,</strong> <em>such as I want to persuade the people in class that replacing the light bulbs in their houses with compact fluorescent bulbs is a useful thing to doâ€ˆOR Iâ€ˆwould like to persuade people to write to their representatives about health care.</em></li>

			<p>In a writing class, you will often hear that the audience is your classmatesâ€”in which case your teacher will grade your writing in response to how well you address the concerns and beliefs of your classmates. But this also means the teacher is a very important part of your audience.</p>
			<p>(Sometimes teachers ask you to write for other audiences besides the class; you will have to ask how you are to learn about those audiences.)</p>

			<p>Your classroom is the immediate context, of courseâ€”but so is your campus and its values and recent events.</p>
			<p>Consider also the values of the community around your school as well as Â­current national and international eventsâ€”how are these likely to shape how your audience will read?</p>
			<p>What has happened recently in your audienceâ€™s individual and shared lives that shapes how they think and feel, in general and on the topic you are considering?</p>
