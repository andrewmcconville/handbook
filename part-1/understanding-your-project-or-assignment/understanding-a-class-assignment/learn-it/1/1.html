			<p>Three levels of purpose shape class writing assignments:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><strong>A teacher’s purposes.</strong> You might be asked to produce polished descriptive prose; carry out research, integrate it into a paper, and document it; or develop and produce a persuasive argument. Look at new assign­ments for state­ments of what the teacher hopes you will learn; if they are not there, ask.</li> 
				<li><strong>Your own purposes for your own learning:</strong> On what skills do you need to focus (some aspect of grammar, or transitions, or writing complex paragraphs)?</li>
				<li><strong>The paper’s purposes,</strong> <em>such as I want to persuade the people in class that replacing the light bulbs in their houses with compact fluorescent bulbs is a useful thing to do OR I would like to persuade people to write to their representatives about health care.</em></li>

			<p>In a writing class, you will often hear that the audience is your classmates—in which case your teacher will grade your writing in response to how well you address the concerns and beliefs of your classmates. But this also means the teacher is a very important part of your audience.</p>
			<p>(Sometimes teachers ask you to write for other audiences besides the class; you will have to ask how you are to learn about those audiences.)</p>

			<p>Your classroom is the immediate context, of course—but so is your campus and its values and recent events.</p>
			<p>Consider also the values of the community around your school as well as ­current national and international events—how are these likely to shape how your audience will read?</p>
			<p>What has happened recently in your audience’s individual and shared lives that shapes how they think and feel, in general and on the topic you are considering?</p>
