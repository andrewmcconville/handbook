				<p>The assignment says I am to write an argumentative<div></div> research paper on a topic of my choice, with the class as my audience. I’ve written research papers before, but I don’t know what “argumentative” means with a research paper. I’ve got to pay attention to how the teacher means “argument.” (And how can I start if I don’t know what it means? I think I need to go talk to her.)</p>
				<p>But “argument” sounds like the overall purpose for the teacher, to show that I know how to make research be an argument. (I’m also not sure what counts as evidence; I’ll have to ask.)</p>
				<p>And I don’t really know the people in class yet, but they seem to be just like everyone else I know on this campus, so I can ask my friends to help me think about this paper.</p>
				<p>The context? Well, it’s this writing class—so I guess that means I also have to be careful about how I write.</p>
				<p>A topic? Is there any way to write about how awful it is when everyone in my family talks about politics, like at dinner last night? Talk about argument!!! It’s awful—and Jenna was saying it’s just like that at her house.</p>
