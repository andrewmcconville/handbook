			<p>Rhetoric developed in the western Mediterranean area over 2,000 years ago as political systems became democratic and leagal institutions came into being. People saw that audiences were moved by some speeches and writings more than by others, and that some speeches and writings not only failed but instead achieved the exact opposite of what their composers had hoped.</p>
