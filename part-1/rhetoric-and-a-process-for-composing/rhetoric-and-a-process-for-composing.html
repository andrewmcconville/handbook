			People who study writers and writing have learned that all effective writers
			follow processes to develop writing. These processes differ in their particulars
			from writer to writer, but generally - when it comes to composing a research
			paper - the processess contain the steps shown on the next page.

			(Keep in mind that, although the process looks linear, writers often move up
			and down among the steps - especially between revising and getting feedback.)

			With each step you become more certain about your audience, context, purpose
			and - eventually - strategies.
