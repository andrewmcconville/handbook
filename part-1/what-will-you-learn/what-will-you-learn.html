		<p>We've composed this book to help you become a stronger communicator. Toward that end, in this book we take a rhetorical approach—as we explain in Part 1, which you are just now starting.</p>
		<p>We have also designed this book around learning outcomes from the Council of <strong>Writing Program Administrators (WPA)</strong>, a group focused on improving writing instruction in the United States.</p>
		<p>Below are the learning outcomes for which Part 1 prepares you. (There are more outcomes you will encounter in later parts.) If you do not know the terms, Part 1 will deﬁne them for you—and the rest of the book will help you develop this very important knowledge.</p>

		<p>Respond appropriately to different kinds of rhetorical situations: As a composer of texts, can you describe the contexts in which your audience(s) receive the texts you compose for them, and how those contexts shape audiences' responses?</p>

		<p>Understand a writing assignment as a series of tasks, including ﬁnding, evaluating, analyzing, and synthesizing appropriate primary and secondary sources: By being able to differentiate the tasks that go into composing a text, are you able to help yourself understand what you need to do at any point in your composing process?</p>
