		<p>We’ve composed this book to help you become a stronger communicator. Toward that end, in this book we take a rhetorical approach—as we explain in Part 1, which you are just now starting.</p>
		<p>We have also designed this book around learning outcomes from the Council of <strong>Writing Program Administrators (WPA)</strong>, a group focused on improving writing instruction in the United States.</p>
		<p>Below are the learning outcomes for which Part 1 prepares you. (There are more outcomes you will encounter in later parts.) If you do not know the terms, Part 1 will deﬁne them for you—and the rest of the book will help you develop this very important knowledge.</p>

		<p>The <abbr title="Writing Program Administrators">WPA</abbr> Outcomes say that “Writers develop rhetorical knowledge by negotiating purpose, audience, context, and conventions as they compose a variety of texts for different situations.” In Part 1, you learn about:</p>
		<p><span class="all-caps">Audiences</span>: As a composer of texts, do you understand how to describe those for whom you compose and then how to shape texts for them?</p>
		<p><span class="all-caps">Purpose</span>: As a composer of texts, do you understand how to articulate a purpose for your text and then to start shaping your text around that purpose? Do you also understand that your purpose might shift was you develop your text?</p>
		<p><span class="all-caps">Different Situations</span>: As a composer of texts, can you describe the contexts in which your audience(s) receive the texts you compose for them, and how those contexts shape audiences’ responses?</p>

		<p>The <abbr title="Writing Program Administrators">WPA</abbr> Outcomes say that “Writers use multiple strategies, or composing processes, to conceptualize, develop, and finalize projects. Composing processes are seldom linear: a writer may research a topic before drafting, then conduct additional research while revising or after consulting a colleague.” </p>
		<p>In Part 1, you are introduced to the steps of one PROCESS for composing a project that requires research. You will see this process at work if you move through this handbook in order; you can also see this process at work in one writer’s development of a research paper. (If you click the P tab above, you can see the steps of this writer’s <span class="all-caps">process</span>.)</p>
